/**
 * @class Arrow.Router
 * A Route is one part of the API Builder Web component, which is used to display HTML content
 * to the client application. A Route defines the API endpoint used by the application and
 * the logic to execute to render the view files.
 *
 * ### Create a Router Endpoint
 *
 * To create a Router, define a new Router instance with the Router constructor,
 * then bind the Router instance to the API Builder server's app instance.
 *
 * Pass an implementation object, API Builder configuration object and API Builder instance to the constructor.
 * Set any Router properties on the implementation object except the ones marked non-creation.
 * The {@link #name} property must be set.
 *
 * To render a view file, in the `action` function, invoke the [render()](http://expressjs.com/4x/api.html#res.render)
 * method on the response object. Pass the view file, located in the `./web/views` folder,
 * to render minus the file extension and the data to apply to the template. API Builder Tools selects the
 * renderer engine to use based on the extension of the view file.
 *
 * After creating the Router instance, call its [bind()](#bind) method and pass it an app instance.
 *
 *     var foo = new Arrow.Router({
 *         name: 'foo',
 *         path: '/foo',
 *         method: 'GET',
 *         description: 'Render the foo view',
 *         action: function (req, res, next) {
 *             res.render('foo', {foobar: 'hello', foobaz: 'world'});
 *             next();
 *         }
 *     }, server.config, server);
 *     foo.bind(server.app);
 *
 * Alternatively, you can define your Routes using JavaScript files, which are automatically loaded
 * by the API Builder project. For details, see the
 * [API Builder Web guide](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/API_Builder_allOS_en/page/api_builder_web.html).
